I am new at ebuild writing. I created some ebuilds for my personal use, but I decided to share them with you!
Please use them with care and at your own risk! Feel free to help me write better ebuilds! :)

The ebuilds
-----------------

* **games-simulation/corsix-th**: Modified the original portage ebuild to match the version 0.30! Disable Videos/ffmpeg USE flag. 
Theres an error with ffmpeg/libav
* **media-video/filebot-bin**: The ultimate tv renamer / subtitle downloader / sfv validator.
* **net-misc/synology-cloud-station**: To sync files among your Synology NAS and computers.
* **net-misc/roger-router**: Roger Router provides a GUI to enhance the possibilities of your Fritz!Box oder Telekom Speedport.
* **www-client/opera-developer**: (discontinued) This ebuild is copied from the BGO Overlay. All thanks to BGO! ;) **www-client/opera-developer** is now in portage
